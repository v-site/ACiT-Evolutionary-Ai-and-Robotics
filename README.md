# ACIT-Evolutionary-Ai-and-Robotics
## Using evolutionary algorithm to derive the controller state-transition function for a CA, and weights for a NN to, control a cart-pole in AIgym



### Instructions:
- The CAmain.py and NNmain.py runs an EA algorithm to find the control paramaters
- CAtestGene.py and NNtestGene.py are visualizations of the EA derived controller-paramaters performance
